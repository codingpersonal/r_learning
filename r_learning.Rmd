## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
setwd("/Users/saurabg/saurabg/practice codes/r_learning/")
getwd()

reddit <- read.csv("reddit.csv")
head(reddit)
levels(reddit$age.range)
library(ggplot2)
qplot(data = reddit, x = age.range)

reddit$age.range_factor <- factor(reddit$age.range, labels = c("Under 18", "18-24"  ,     "25-34",       "35-44",       "45-54"   ,    "55-64", "65 or Above" ))
reddit$age.range_factor
qplot(data=reddit, x = age.range_factor)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
